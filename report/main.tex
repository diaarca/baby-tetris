\section{Question 1: Discounted MDP For Player}
\label{sec:question1}
\subsection{Implementation}
\subsubsection{Main Architecture}
\quad Based on the our design choices from Section~\ref{sec:question1}, we
decided to use an object oriented architecture (C++) for our implementation.
\par For our structure we have declared 7 classes:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \code{Point}: classical point (x,y) class used for grid coordinates
    \item \code{Field}: the class that contain a boolean grid s.t. grid[i][j] =
        1 if the corresponding cell is fill in the field
    \item \code{Tromino}: the class that correspond to the baby Tetris pieces
        (I Piece or L Piece)
    \item \code{State}: the class that contain both a field grid and an
        incoming Tromino
    \item \code{Action}: that represent an action choosable on a given state
        (combination for placement and rotation of an incoming Tromino)
    \item \code{Game}: the class that contain the configuration (completed lines
        scores), the current state and score of a baby Tetris game (the
        configuration is loaded from a file : \code{config.txt})
    \item \code{MDP}: the class that all the necessary methods in order to
        compute the value iteration over a game
\end{enumerate}

Now that we overviewed the global implementation architecture, we will describe
our implementation choices.
\subsubsection{Implementation Choices}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Piece teleported to their final position}: in order to make
        the number of intermediate states when choosing an action, we compute on
        a state all available actions on this state, then according to the
        policy we make a choice over these actions and we teleport the incoming
        piece in the current state directly to its final position (with the
        right rotation)
    \item \textbf{Reward Function}: The reward function as defined in
        Section~\ref{sec:question1} take both the current state $s$ and an
        available action $a_s$. Here since we can calculate the available
        actions, we can know in which state $s'$ we're going to arrive and we
        can compute directly in $s'$ the number of completed lines before remove
        them right to the game. Then we abstract the reward function by counting
        the number of complete lines in the resulting state
    \item \textbf{Game Ending}: According to the subject, the game should end
        whenever a piece exceed the height limit of the grid. Again there, we
        can compute all available actions on a given state, since we cannot
        place a Tromino outside the grid, such an action will not appear in the
        set of available actions. Then the game end when there is no available
        action for the current game
        state
    \item \textbf{Max Iteration}: Since the value iteration isn't an exact
        method, if we fix an $\epsilon$ which is too small, we may iterate for a
        very long moment. For this reason we fix a maximum number of iteration
        for the expected value improvement, then we always a value iteration
        which compute in a reasonable time even if the expected value vector is
        less qualitative than the $\epsilon$ margin we fixed
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Incoming Improvement}
\quad For now we compute naively the value iteration algorithm on all state
combinations, which represents
\[
    = 2^{\text{gridHeight} * \text{gridWidth}} * \text{nbOfTrominoTypes} \\
    = 2^{4*4} * 2 \\
    = 2^{17} \\
    = 131072
\]
states. In the near future we want to considerably reduce this number by
computing the value iteration only an states that are reachable from a given
starting state $s_0$. For this purpose, we will make use of a Breadth First
Search algorithm which will explore iteratively all reachable states from the
current one.
